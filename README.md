## Awaitless
---

Awaitless is a lightweight, zero-dependency Promises utility that provides a set of useful operations on Promises, geared towards projects that do not have access to async-await.

This is particularly useful for projects that transpile from a pre-ES6 versioned language, but run on a more up-to-date version of Node.
